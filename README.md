Scripts to generate short music functional ear training samples with answers embedded in id3 tag lyrics

## Overview

The Mr. Ear ear training music samples available for download were generated by the Python
scripts in this repos. The scripts depend on the Petrucci melody ngram datasets available
[here](http://www.peachnote.com/datasets.html) from Vladimir Viro.

I began experimenting with these scripts when I realized through extensive efforts at
musical ear training, that the process of developing a good ear for relative pitch in
tonal music was going to take many hours of training. And I realized that I was never going to
spend the necessary time using ear training software such as --Ear Master-- or transcribing
music, because the
spare time I had at home, would be spent playing the piano. I hypothesized that a large
data set of short mp3 files with music samples that I could put on my mobile phone might
be able to exercise the same brain functions involved in transcribing music.
In order for the music samples to be useful, I knew I needed a way to be able to check my
answers, and I eventually discovered that answers could be put into id3 tags within the mp3
files.

With a trained ear, it is possible to put all these samples into a single playlist and
just by listening, be able to determine the pitch collection, and sequence of pitches. To
train the ear with these samples, it is probably best to take each collection of samples
on one at a time. Initially, I started with the Diatonic collection (Ionian mode). Since I
couldn't even guesss the answer intially, I would just check the answer and sing along
with solfege syllables. I restrict my solfege to just 12
syllables, do re ra re me mi fa fi so le la te ti,
(phonetically - doe rah ray may mee fah fee sow lay lah tay tee). The answers in the lyrics
use scale degrees, which to me are less confusing than written solfege syllables
(1 ♭2 2 ♭3 3 4 ♯4 5 ♭6 6 ♭7 7). The effort required to get fluent at
translating between the 12 written scale degrees and the 12 spoken solfege syllables was
miniscule compared to the ear training itself.

To try out these samples, download the repos zip file, and import the gm directories
into a music library or onto a mobile device. Use a music app that can will display id3 lyrics embedded in
mp3 files (I have used the built in iPhone music app and MP3+ Player for iPhone). I would be
interested in knowing of others for iPhone. Getting new samples
onto the iPhone while experimenting has also been a tremendous pain! And one version of IOS dropped
the lyrics display capability (but now back).

I always use random shuffle and repeat 1 song when playing them.

## Generating the gm Samples

The following steps assume a unix environment (I use Cygwin).

### Step 1: Clone this repos or download and explode .zip file

### Step 2: Obtain and reformat the Petrucci datasets (see link above)

Put the imslp-interval-%dgram-20110401.csv files in ../Petrucci, cd into there and run

`../motif-generator/reformatPetrucci.py 1 12`

### Step 3: Generate a midi file of all the samples

Just run:

`genmotifs.py`

Although there are many options, by default, it should generate two files gm.log and gm.mid

### Step 3: Render the gm.mid midi file into a gm.wav audio file

For this step I use Reaper, a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) application.

### Step 4: Clip the gm.wav file into many short files in subdirectories under gm directory.

Just run:

`clipmotifs.py gm`

This should generate 9 subdirectories with 200-300 .wav samples each. The 9 subdirs contain
melody samples from:
Diatonic (or Ionian), Mixolydian, Aeolian, Dorian, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Phrygian,
Major Plus 1 Chromatic, and Minor Plus 1 Chromatic.

### Step 5: Run the gm_mp3.sh to convert the .wav files to .mp3 and to add the lyrics tag

Just run:

`gm_mp3.sh`

This generated script runs `lame` to convert the .mp3 and then runs the python script - tagmotifs.py
in order to extract the answers from the gm.log file and insert them as id3 tags in the .mp3 files.
The .mp3 files are written to a directory tree under 'gm_mp3'.
